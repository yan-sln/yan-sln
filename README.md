# Hello there ! 👋  

I'm a **self-taught developer** who learns by building.  
Most of my projects start with a real problem I encounter — and coding becomes my way to create a solution.  

> 💡 *"I don’t just learn to code — I code to learn."*

## 🚀 About Me  

- 🎓 Engineering student bridging **Computer Science**, **Biology** and **Humanities and Social Sciences**.  
- 🌍 I see **computer science as a toolbox** to explore, model, and solve real-world challenges —  
  from biology and data to automation and creativity.  
- 🔭 I mainly code using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.  
- ⚡ I enjoy connecting technology with everyday life: automation, creativity, and efficiency.
